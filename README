BUILD & TEST
There are few targets available: rsyncme_d, rsyncme, test executables.

To build rsyncme_d (daemon's executable):
	cd src
	make debug (or make release)

To build rsyncme (commandline executable):
	cd src
	make rsyncme-debug (or make rsyncme-release)
To build tests:
	cd src
	make test
To run tests:
	cd src
	make test-check
		Make will execute all cmocka test-suites.
		Results of each are written in folder ./test/build/release/log. Short summary
		is saved in rsyncme_test_<#>_<timestamp>.log file. Detailed log is saved
		in rsyncme_test_<#>_<timestamp>.err. If you would like to inspect intermadiate
		files created during test <#> run, please change RM_TEST_DELETE_FILES
		definition in file test/include/test_rm<#>.h to 0.
To build tests in debug mode:
	cd src
	make test-debug
		Output is written to ./test/build/debug.
To run tests built in debug mode:
	cd src
	make test-debug-check
		Make will execute all cmocka test-suites.
		Results of each are written in folder ./test/build/debug/log. Short summary
		is saved in rsyncme_test_<#>_<timestamp>.log file. Detailed log is saved
		in rsyncme_test_<#>_<timestamp>.err. If you would like to inspect intermadiate
		files created during test <#> run, please change RM_TEST_DELETE_FILES
		definition in file test/include/test_rm<#>.h to 0.


CLEAN
To clean rsyncme_d (daemon's executable) and rsyncme (commandline executable):
	cd src
	make clean
To clean tests (but not test logs):
	cd src
	make test-clean
To clean test logs:
	cd src
	make test-clean-logs
To clean tests-debug build(but not test logs):
	cd src
	make test-clean-debug
To clean test-debug logs:
	cd src
	make test-clean-logs-debug
To clean test and test logs (release and debug):
	cd src
	make test-clean-all
To clean rsyncme_d, rsyncme, tests & test logs (release & debug):
	cd src
	make clean-all
