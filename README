4.BUILD & TEST

There are few targets available: rsyncme_d, rsyncme, test executables.

4.1 Dependencies

All sources depend on libuuid, so please be sure it is installed on your system
or install it using our script (this will install cmocka support too, which is required
if you wish to run tests).

4.1.1 Installing libuuid:

    A. Manually
        apt-get install uuid uuid-dev
    B. Using our script
	    bash install_deps.sh cmocka   (give name of folder where to install cmocka,
                                        e.g. "cmocka", you may need sudo to install
                                        packages)
        
Our tests depend on cmocka, which depends on cmake, so please be sure
to have them installed first if you want to run tests (you can do it manually
following below instructions or run our install_deps.sh script).

4.1.2 Installing cmocka:

    A. Using script:
	    bash install_deps.sh cmocka   (give name of folder where to install cmocka,
                                        e.g. "cmocka", you may need sudo to install
                                        packages)

    B. To install manually:
	    First, install cmake:
	        sudo apt-get install cmake
        Then install cmocka:
	        1. Download https://cmocka.org/files/1.0/cmocka-1.0.1.tar.xz
	        2. Follow instructions from INSTALL file

4.2 Default release build:
    cd src
    make    (will build everything [apart from tests] in release mode,
            same as "make all" and "make release")

4.3 Default debug build:
    cd src
    make debug


5. TESTS

Please be sure dependencies are installed (see 4.1)

5.1. To build tests:

Make sure cmocka support is installed (see 4.1)
	cd src
	make test       ("make test-debug" for debug)

5.2 To run tests:

	cd src
	make test-check     ("make test-check-debug" for debug)
        Make will execute all cmocka test-suites.
        Results of each are written in folder ROOT/test/build/release/log
        (ROOT/test/build/debug/log if debug tests are executed)
        Short summary of each executed test suite is saved
        in rsyncme_test_<#>_<timestamp>.log file. Detailed log is saved
        in rsyncme_test_<#>_<timestamp>.err for each of the test suites.
        If you would like to inspect intermediate files created during each
        test suite <#> run, please change RM_TEST_<#>_DELETE_FILES
        definition in header ROOT/test/include/test_rm<#>.h to 0.


6. DEBUGGING

Debugging should be done from ROOT/test/src folder.
E.g:
    piotr@world:~/projects/rsyncme/test/src$ gdb ../build/debug/test_rm_main1


7. CLEAN

    To clean everything:
	    cd src
	    make clean-all

    To clean rsyncme_d (daemon's executable) and rsyncme (commandline executable):
	    cd src
	    make clean

    To clean tests (but not test logs):
	    cd src
	    make test-clean

    To clean test logs:
	    cd src
	    make test-clean-logs

    To clean tests-debug build(but not test logs):
	    cd src
	    make test-clean-debug

    To clean test-debug logs:
	    cd src
	    make test-clean-logs-debug

    To clean test and test logs (release and debug):
	    cd src
	    make test-clean-all
