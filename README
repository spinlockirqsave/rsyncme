BUILD & TEST
There are few targets available: rsyncme_d, rsyncme, test executables.

To build rsyncme_d (daemon's executable):
	cd src
	make debug (or make release)

To build rsyncme (commandline executable):
	cd src
	make rsyncme-debug (or make rsyncme-release)
To build tests:
	cd src
	make test
To run tests:

		files created during test run, please change RM_TEST_DELETE_FILES
		definition in file test/include/test_rm.h to 0.
