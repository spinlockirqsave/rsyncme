1. OVERVIEW

rsyncme can be used to synchronize data on the same machine (locally)
or between endpoints connected over IP. There is always constant part
of all commands using rsyncme, -x and -y options necessarily followed
by file names, for example

    rsyncme push -x @x -y @y

In all possible commands -x gives always the name of the file that you want
to use as a new/current version of data and you want to make the target file
@y the same as this version.


2. EXAMPLE

Let us assume two files, calc1.ods and calc2.ods are present in ~/Documents
directory and you made some changes to calc1.ods (a value of single cell
has been changed in this example). You now wish to synchronize
calc2.ods to be same as just changed calc1.ods. You can do it with push command:

    $ rsyncme push -x ~/Documents/calc1.ods -y ~/Documents/calc2.ods

    Local push.

    method      : DELTA_RECONSTRUCTION (block [512])
    bytes       : [15744] (by raw [7040], by refs [8704])
    deltas      : [31] (raw [14], refs [17])
    time        : real [0.002247]s, cpu [0.003514]s
    bandwidth   : [7.007268]MB/s

    OK.

It can be read from the output that source file @x is 15744 bytes and delta
reconstruction procedure has been used as synchronization method (as opposed
to copying of bytes). This method has resulted in 31 delta elements being
created. 14 of them contained raw bytes, while 17 contained references
to matching blocks found in old version of file (@y) and reused (no copying
involved). As a result 7040 bytes from new file has been used, avoiding
copying of 8704 bytes (which have been copied from referenced file).


3. OPTIONS

push        Set up @x as source of changes, @y as result/output.
pull        Set up @y as source of changes, @x as result/output.
-x          The name of source of changes (if push, see -y if pull)
-y          The name of target to be synchronized to be same as @x, it is
            reference file (if push, see -x if pull).
-z          The new name of target.
--leave     Will leave reference file unchanged, producing output as @z.
--force     Will create @y if it doesn't exist.
--version   Will output version of program.
--help      Will print short help information.
-l          The size of block used in synchronization algorithm [in bytes].
            Default used is 512.
-a          Copy all threshold [in bytes]. The file will be sent as raw bytes
            if it's size is less than this.
-t          Copy tail threashold [in bytes]. Bytes will be sent litearally
            instead of performing rolling match algorithm
            if there is less than this to be processed.
-s          Send threshold [in bytes]. This determines the maximum size
            of delta raw element. Bytes will be queued up to this number
            if the match is not found in @y. If the match is found at some
            point before the limit is reached and delta reference to matching
            block is just to be senti (or the EOF is reached), then already
            accumulated bytes are sent immediately.


4. LOCAL SYNCHRONIZATION

If the -i option is not given in the command, that means this is local sync.
The basic command to synchronize file @x and file @y on the same machine is

    rsyncme push -x @x -y @y

This command will synchronize file @y with @x, that is @y will be the same
as @x after this is done, and @x is unchanged.
The basic command will create sychronized version of @y with the same name
and in the same location, but this can be changed with -z and/or --leave option.

4.1 OPTIONS

4.1.1 -z OPTION

    rsyncme push -x @x -y @y -z @z

This will output new version of @y as @z, i.e. @y becomes @z.

4.1.2 --leave OPTION

    rsyncme push -x @x -y @y -z @z --leave

will work as 2.1.2 but @y file will not be deleted.

4.1.3 -l OPTION

    rsyncme push -x @x -y @y -l block_size

Use different size of block for synchronization. This option influences
number of matches found and number of raw bytes used. The general rule
is less this value is more matches are found while simultaneously less
this value is less space for performance improvement is left.
Example:

    rsyncme push -x @x -y @y -l 16

This will use 16 bytes as synchronization block size.


5. REMOTE SYNCHRONIZATION

Remote synchronization will be implemented in 0.1.3 version.
